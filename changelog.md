Changelog next version:
* Renamed method `CloudEventWithSubscriptionPosition.getStreamPosition()` to `CloudEventWithSubscriptionPosition.getSubscriptionPosition()` since this was a typo.
* Added ability to provide a list of conditions when composing them with `and` and `or`.
* Added special convenience (overloaded) method for creating "or" with "equal to" conditions. For example you can now do: `filter(type(or("x", "y"))`. 
  Before you had to do: `filter(type(or(eq("x"), eq("y")))`.
* MongoDB event streams are now explicitly sorted by natural order by default. The reason for this is that just relying on default "sorting" on read lead to wrong order on certain occasions.
* Writing an empty stream to a mongodb-based event store will just ignore the stream and not try to persist the empty stream to the datastore.
* Upgraded to cloudevents sdk 2.0.0-milestone3
* Non-backward compatible change: `CatchupSupportingBlockingSubscription` no longer requires a subscription position storage during the catch-up phase. 
  Instead, you pass the storage implementation to `CatchupSupportingBlockingSubscriptionConfig` along with the position persistence predicate.
* `BlockingSubscriptionWithAutomaticPositionPersistence` now implements the `PositionAwareBlockingSubscription` interface
* Removed the generic type T from the `org.occurrent.subscription.api.blocking.BlockingSubscription` and `org.occurrent.subscription.api.reactor.ReactorSubscription`.
  The reason for this was the implementation returning different kinds of CloudEvent implementations where not compatible. For example if you created a Spring Bean
  with a `T` of `CloudEventWithSubscriptionPosition` then such a subscription couldn't be assigned to a field expecting a subscription with just `CloudEvent`.
  To avoid having users to know which cloud event implementation to expect, we change the API so that it always deals with pure `CloudEvent`'s. 
  Implementors now have to use `org.occurrent.subscription.PositionAwareCloudEvent.getSubscriptionPositionOrThrowIAE(cloudEvent)` to get the position.
  It's also possible to check if a `CloudEvent` contains a subscription position by calling `org.occurrent.subscription.PositionAwareCloudEvent.hasSubscriptionPosition(cloudEvent)`.
* Fixed several corner-cases for the `CatchupSupportingBlockingSubscription`, it should now be safer to use and produce fewer duplicates when switching from catch-up to continuous subscription mode.
* Added "exists" method to the `BlockingSubscriptionPositionStorage` interface (and implemented for all implementations of this interface).
* The global position of `PositionAwareBlockingSubscription` for MongoDB increases the "increment" of the current `BsonTimestamp` by 1 in order to avoid 
  duplicate potential duplication of events during replay. 

Version 0.1.1 (2020-09-26):

* Catchup subscriptions (blocking)
* EveryN for stream persistence (both blocking and reactive)
* Added "count" to EventStoreQueries (both blocking and reactive)
* Added ability to query for "data" attribute in EventStoreQueries and subscriptions
